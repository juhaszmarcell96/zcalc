- superposition (multiple sources -> multiple graphs with only 1 source enabled, others deactivated -> add the results)
- current source (for now, only voltage source is implemented)
- composite components
    - internally consisting of passive elements and nodes
    - exposes nodes as connections
    - the goal is it build up to being able to validate e.g. home electrical networks
        - having e.g. circuit break with a near 0 resistor inside, checking the current of the resistor -> detect shorts

- knwown bugs
    - sometimes there is a jump in the phase plot -> continuity must be ensured
    - first decade does not have vertical lines
